TODO:
- Tabbed navigation (radio button based)
- Dropdowns (checkbox based)
- Modals (checkbox based)
- Pure css progress bars
- Maybe breadcrumbs
- Maybe button groups (with radios maybe? - use first and last to style borders)
- Alerts with checkbox?
- Add more utilities for Media objects
- Possibly panels
- Responsive embed?
- Are tooltips even doable? (they are on-click as popovers for sure with checkboxes)
- Buttons with states (implemented using a checkbox)
- Checbox collapses
- Is a Pure CSS Carousel even possible?

ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE:
- Make a set of pages for the live version like base-modules, customization, extra-modules to showcase the modules and not clutter the main page
- Link to said pages from main page (move the grid's stuff to the other page and also the minimal note with the two **)
- Update wiki with changes, write missing pages (documentation etc.)
- Add the missing extra components, try to stay below 5KB
- Add images and make two live pages to showcase vastly different flavors
- Make NiteOwl flavor (dark flavor, like the thing that cquanu (my star in html template) has for github, colors look cool)
- Make a Bootstrap flavor to ease the transition from that framework
- Make more flavors
- Promote in reddit etc.
- Write a blog post about it
- Use it
