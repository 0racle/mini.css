# mini.css

A minimal Sass-y responsive mobile-first style-agnostic CSS framework.



TODO:
- Later down the line 
  - A *material-design* module and/or flavor could be added
  - An alternative grid system using `flexbox` or `grid`
- Documentation and packaging
  - Live pages, showcase the modules, customization and flavors
  - Update menu's and stuff
  - Add pictures in README.md and showcase flavors (also in wiki)
  - Package for NPM and Bowser
- Flavors
  - NiteOwl Flavor (dark flavor, like the thing that cquanu has for github, colors look cool)
  - Bootstrap Flavor (to ease transition from that framework)
  - Pure.CSS Flavor (maybe?)
  - More
- Others
  - Promote in reddit, blog, etc
  - Write about the development process in blog
  - Use it forever
